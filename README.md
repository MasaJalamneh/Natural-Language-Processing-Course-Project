Project Name
Improving Online Shopping Decisions by Ranking Product Reviews. 
 
Project Idea
This project focuses on enhancing the way we analyze and
 rank product reviews on e-commerce platforms like Amazon.

 order, which doesn't always highlight the most helpful or reliable ones.

 shopping experience smarter and more trustworthy.
