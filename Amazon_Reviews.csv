Japanese women wear a lot of makeup during the day and most of the makeup on the shelves there are very waterproof to combat the high humidity during the summers. I found this product after testing it in a store once and I can't really do it justice by a written review, that's just how awesome it is. It takes off even the most stubborn of waterproof makeup with one swipe. I like to use 1 full pump on a cotton pad and wipe at my makeup; that seems to work the best for me. My mother pumps it directly on to her hand and scrubs it on her face which also works great too but I like to physically see how much dirt and grime comes off my face at the end of the day to really trust that my face is clean. I use this before I wash my face to have a squeaky clean face before bed. I LOVE it. And it lasts for a while; I got mine in June and it's now November with half a bottle to go. I'd definitely recommend this to any girl who wears makeup and likes to sleep with a clean face every night.",11/5/2013

The reason I gave it three stars was because in addition to the difficulty after a little while later with normal body heat or from being in the florida weather the was would melt and then it would just look like a bunch of tan looking wax on my mustache similar to gel on hair when it dries up or you sleep with it overnight. I think that it might still work for others but it didn't for me.<br /><br />Final Thoughts and Personal Opinion: I would like to say I still gave it 3 stars because the company fully stands behind its product. If this is something that you're looking for give it a try, you might have a better experience otherwise they're always there to help.<br /><br />Reviewed by Rody Aroche",5/29/2015

Since then, I have been using it daily to wash and moisturize my face.<br />First, let me strt with the presentation. The kit came in a very cute package box. I really liked how pretty it ws. It definitely looks like a good gift for a friend. I love the containers the products renin. The box for the soap opens up like a flower and holds the bar in the place. The lotion is in a very secure glass jar that feels like both very high quality and durable. Both products look very nice on my counter.<br /><br />The soap smells very wonderful. I really like washing my face with it as it does not leave it dry nor sticky like some cleansers do. I cut up the soap into four squares so that I can control how much I use of it better.<br /><br />The moisturizer is my fvorige part. It feels so wonderful on my skin! Just a little of it is enough to cover my whole face-- though sometimes I do two layers because I enjoy the feeling of it. It really is very nice and feels wonderful.<br /><br />As for the effectiveness of the products, I have been using em for 10 days and my face does feel a little cleaner, smoother, and softer. It's not a dramatic change, but I have only been using it for a short time. I expect greater results with time and will update this review accordingly. Thank you Aya Natiral!",8/31/2015

I use BioSilk shampoo & conditioner, then I spray 12 Benefits Healthy Hair Treatment (SO AMAZING), brush my hair, and let it air dry. The next morning I used these curlers. I left them in for the longest time so that the curls would be tight curls and they would relax throughout the day. Well that was wishful thinking because after about 20 minutes (after I took the curlers out) my hair was just plain wavy. So I thought my hair was just too clean. So the next time I tried it I washed my hair exactly the same & even used my hair treatment again but I also used mousse in my hair thinking it would make the curls stick. NOPE. Same thing happened. SO, the THIRD time I attempted to do my hair I used my same shampoo & conditioner routine but DID NOT put my hair treatment in, instead I used some hair wax and let my hair dry. That still didn't make the curls stay. I do have fine hair but my hair can last with curls all day if I use my straightener or curling wand. I really wanted to use curlers to make my morning routine more simple but it has just become more frustrating. I don't think the velvety coating on these rollers is a good idea for my thin hair I think that's why my hair won't stay curled? Unfortunately, I will be returning these. I did like the clips that came with these rollers though. I know some people mentioned it leaves marks in your hair but I found out, by my trial and errors, that if you kind of brush your hair with the clip when you are putting it on the roller (after you have already rolled up your hair) that you don't get the marks in your hair. Worked for me anyway.",12/22/2014

I've tried tons of products promising new skin and heels so fancy, you'll never want to wear shoes, again. Nothing worked. My heels are probably typical of most women who go to the gym, wear sandals all summer, and wear those &#34;cute&#34; shoes that kill us. I use the Pedi Egg and various &#34;sanders&#34; from Beauty Brands each time I shower. Though the simple things like homemade foot scrubs, sanding, and lotion can help, nothing, and I mean nothing, worked like this product! After weeks and weeks of researching and humming and hawing, it went on sale and I bought it. Here's my tip to success: Soak feet. Take a nice long bath. I used bubbles, made myself some nice tea, brought in my iPad and watched about 40 minutes of TV to pass the time. (I hate baths. This part was the hardest for me.) Then I dried my feet a little, and while still prune toed from the bath, slipped the pre-gel booties on and put on a pair of my husband's socks over them to help keep them in place. I left mine on for 90 mins (suggested by a blogger) and then rinsed them off. My feet had a sheen to them and smelled nice but that was it. A watched foot does not peel. Day 2: Soaked just my feet in a foot bath for 30 mins. Nothing exciting but my feet felt relaxed from the hot water. Day 3: Whoa. My big toe, previously callused, peeled a little. I couldn't help but pick a tiny bit to reveal all this new skin under what felt like a giant mound of dead skin. Day 4: The sides of my feet started to peel some along with my heels a tiny bit. I continued to soak daily from 20-45 mins. I also have been wearing socks and sneakers all week. I've also sent out texts to multiple friends who were disgusted. Day 5: The magic starts to happen! More peeling...even around my toenails where I thought nothing bad was happening. Apparently, dry dead skin resided there, too. Right now I'm on Day 8: The majority of the peeling is over. I have been taking daily foot soaks/baths, using a washcloth to rub off dead skin during the foot bath, and today I peeled a little by hand because I couldn't help myself. Not much more peeling is happening. There's a few bits here and there but as I lay in bed, rubbing my once sandpaper feeling feet together, images of silk feet pop in my head. They feel so nice and the cracks and calluses are gone! I'll probably shed another day or two and be done with it. I'll buy this product, again, and will recommend this over any expensive pedicure any woman dare try (and I've even done the pedi where they razor cut your skin off your heels!). This is worth it. I have felt no pain. My feet look amazing. There's really nothing to it besides trying to hide your feet during the molting.

There's a few bits here and there but as I lay in bed, rubbing my once sandpaper feeling feet together, images of silk feet pop in my head. They feel so nice and the cracks and calluses are gone! I'll probably shed another day or two and be done with it. I'll buy this product, again, and will recommend this over any expensive pedicure any woman dare try (and I've even done the pedi where they razor cut your skin off your heels!). This is worth it. I have felt no pain. My feet look amazing. There's really nothing to it besides trying to hide your feet during the molting.

The 12X magnification on the Swissco is clear - no distortion. The mirror is 5 inches in diameter, as stated, which is plenty large to view your face (too large for a purse, but fine for a large tote bag). The 12x magnification is perfect for grooming chores or cosmetics applications that your eyes may miss. We attached the Swissco to our vanity wall mirror. The 2 suction cups are large enough to provide good support. Be sure to mount it so the suction cups are on the horizontal. If you mount the suction cups vertically, it is possible for the mirror to fall if the suction cups loosen over time. We plan on taking one along when traveling.

If you check, it's the same pattern over and over. They review Viviscal, and on the same day a few other products--I suppose to make it seem like they are real customers. But that's it--no other reviews from any other day. Sure, so believeable! And I have a bridge to sell you...<br /><br />Now on to my experience! Earlier in the year I had to go on blood pressure medication that made my hair fall out. It was gradual at first, but began to pick up speed. Changed to a different kind, and with days my hair was falling out by the handfuls. I was beyond upset! Switched to a third medicine and the fallout stopped, but by then the damage was done. I had had incredibly thick hair, and it was soooo much thinner. I realize no one could tell, but it was still upsetting. Quite by accident, I was on a forum (not related to hair) and someone mentioned their hair improved by taking Viviscal.<br /><br />After about a month, it seemed like my eyelashes and eyebrows were a bit fuller, but wasn't sure if it was my imagination/wishful thinking. (These had thinned over time due to normal aging.) Now, after two months, they are definitely getting more lush! I am thrilled!!<br /><br />As for hair growth, I definitely can see the new hairs growing in at my temples. Can't really say if that's due to the vitamins, or just normal hair growth from stopping the bad medicine. Will try to update this review over time!<br /><br />One other thing to add: I see others have mentioned getting acne while on this. I am VERY acne prone and have not had this happen.",8/31/2015

All opinions expressed are my own.*<br /><br />This bottle of XTAVA Define Lashes Volumizing Waterproof Mascara came packaged in a box that has a shiny sticker on both ends, showing that it had not been tampered with before it arrived to me. I really liked that. I cut one of the stickers in order to open the box to get to the mascara. When I pulled the wand out of the bottle, it was very flexible and quite a bit of the liquid came out on the wand. I had to put the wand back in the bottle to try to get the liquid off of it before applying to my lashes. I had to do this several times throughout application. I didn't really feel like this mascara &#34;volumized&#34; my lashes persay, but it did make the length of them show up a little more vividly than if I did not have on any mascara at all. My lashes did not clump together a whole lot. What did clump together, I was able to pull apart before they dried. I had to apply several coats of mascara to be able to see that they mascara was even on my eyes. As the day went on, I hit my lashes several times and the mascara did not come off. I really liked that about this product. Overall, I think it's a decent product, but not sure if I would order again since I have some other mascaras that have more of a plumping/volumizing feature than this one - if that's the specific feature you're going for. If you want a product that makes your lashes look more &#34;natural&#34;, then this is the one.",8/19/2015

After 2 weeks of using it my skin was noticeably softer; my boyfriend came to visit and commented on how abnormally soft my skin was (I kinda didn't want to tell him about the soap)! I use it every night in the shower (no rag) and in the morning on my face (every other morning may work as well). A little goes a long way, you don't need to slather it on. It is extremely drying but I use 100% Shea Butter, I did have to use regular lotion at some point and it worked fine, I did have to apply a bit more than usual though.

Oz.",Beauty,5,4,5,N,Y,Works like magic...seriously.,"My feet have a tendency to get calloused, and it's pretty difficult to get rid of the dead skin that develops on the heels. Scrubs are great for light exfoliation, but anyone with dry, cracked heels will tell you that even the most luxurious scrubs do nothing in that department. I was skeptical when I ordered Baby Foot, but the slew of good reviews on Amazon - as well as a few on Buzzfeed - prompted me to give it a whirl. At only $20 bucks, I figured it wasn't that much of a risk. Boy am I glad I tried it! Read on...<br /><br />About a week ago, I used the product. I followed the instructions and cleaned/soaked my feet beforehand, and then slipped on the booties (the smell is pretty wonderful). I put socks over those and watched TV for the next hour (warning: don't walk around while wearing the booties, as you might slip and injure yourself). After sitting still for exactly one hour, I rinsed the gel-like residue from my feet and went on with my life.<br /><br />Over the next few days, nothing miraculous occurred. My feet were still dry, chapped, and gross. Exactly six days after my &#34;treatment&#34;, I decided to soak my feet in some warm water (peeling occurs within 5-7 days, and I hoped this would help facilitate the peeling process). I filled a foot bath with hot water and Epsom salts and relaxed for an hour. I was not prepared for what I saw when I took my feet out of the water...<br /><br />SKIN. Chunks of rubbery, white, dead skin were hanging off my feet. It didn't hurt at all, and as I excitedly pulled away the dead layers (much like a child ripping the paper off a Christmas package), I saw healthy, new skin beneath. It was a miracle! I almost had a heart attack, but in a happy way.<br /><br />Sometimes, beauty treatments can be gross before they work. My feet are still peeling a bit, but I am hooked. This method is so much easier than furiously scrubbing at your dead skin with a Ped Egg, or some other exfoliator. Just make sure you follow the instructions, and 5-7 days after the treatment, soak your feet thoroughly. You won't be disappointed.ak your feet thoroughly. You won't be disappointed.",8/31/2015

Almost like glass against my skin.,"I waited a few weeks to post a review as I really wanted to see how this soap performed. First opening the box, the coconut and papaya smell really came through, it was faint yet refreshing. After using it in the shower, the scent practically disappeared. It's extremely hard to smell anything, which is alright for some, but for me I enjoy smelling that clean scent.<br /><br />As for performance, the soap lathers well and was smooth, not too rough on the skin for the first few uses. Once the soap is worked down a bit and those thread like pieces of papaya (I guess?) start poking through, it was like rubbing sandpaper all over my skin. The soap is extremely harsh, too much so, and left red marks along my body.<br /><br />Comparatively speaking, I absolutely love Nubian Heritage's African Black Soap. It's not as harsh against my skin when worn down a bit; it has just enough exfoliation. The scent also does not fade like this coconut and papaya soap scent does. Needless to say, I'll be going back to their African Black soap.",1/20/2015

I've never had high end eye-shadow except some Clinique I was gifted so I can't compare it in that aspect, but the pigmentation on these is less than the Coloricon by WetnWild. All the shades are usable on me except one, the highlight from the second quad (third from the top row left to right). It's almost the same as my skin tone and dissapears. I think overall this is lacking in highlight shades. Technically there should be 3 ( one per quad) but only the top left is light enough for my skin tone. The highlight for the right quad is beautiful but a medium tone on me that works more as a lid color. Because of that the concept of these being arranged as quads doesn't work for me. I find myself reaching for an additional highlight eyeshadow to complete a look. But I'm still happy with this and it offers something I didn't have in my collection.

The &#34;twist and blow dry&#34; technique described on the bottle didn't work for me, but I used a flat iron to curl a few pieces of hair here and there and my whole head looked full of waves and texture. (In the past, when I've tried using the flat iron to create beachy waves, it was difficult because I had to curl every single strand, or else the shiny straight bits were obvious. But this product makes the hair look more mussed and &#34;matte&#34; so you can get away with just curling a few sections on top.)<br /><br />I should add that I used this spray along with the perfectly undone shampoo, conditioner, and mousse, so I can't say which product had the biggest effect on my hair or if it was all of them working together.",5/24/2015

But maybe that's because I have curly hair? I think if you had straight here, you would never have that problem.<br /><br />I was not able to handle all of the lights out, but I do toss and turn throughout the night and it moved with me, where I was constantly having to adjust it. There was really no way for me to force this to you stay put especially because the earplugs are near the strap. So it kind of just kept pushing them in or moving the ear plugs also. It was kind of weird, I ended up taking out the earplugs just because they were getting on my nerves. It may just be me, but I really don't like wearing earplugs anyway.

But I have such straight hair without any real body so the beachy look just isn't a good look for me, unlike in my younger years when I loosely permed my hair and my hair would look great at the beach even after swimming in the ocean half the day. I tried twisting my hair and styling per the instructions for straight hair, and it just didn't look good at all. My hair ended up looking stringy, sloppy and unstyled. To be fair, I don't think any spray on product could give me that awesome beachy look due to my straight hair type.<br /><br />If I spray this Tresemme on my damp hair and blow dry as usual with a round brush, it does adds a little lift, volume and texture to my straight hair. But it's just one more product to add to the routine as it doesn't substitute for my hair gel or any other product, and I still need to finish with my Zero Weight Gel for shaping, hair separation and taming flyaway hairs. This Tresemme may work great for curly or wavy hair, but for my straight hair it doesn't create an attractive beachy look.

It IS matte, it dries somewhat quickly, but ends up being quite thick on. The color is very chic, although it's a little different than the photo, I'd say less muted/less burgundy. It's a good buy.

The positive reviews were numerous and the negative/side effects really only centered around breakouts. I used to have adolescent acne but was entirely manageable, not bad and to this day use still love using my Proactiv products, skin is clear and great, so I thought if this at all happened to me, it would not be that bad and breakout i could manage. WRONG, dead wrong!! NEVER ever have i experienced an acne breakout like this and one that is a little painful. I started see some whiteheads on my jawline and my checks, didn't think too much of it - was in the sun and wearing sunscreen and thought it was the sweat. But then, I worked out, wore a sports bra (usual routines) and when i took it off, the amount of acne and rash that was now visible on my upper back was disgusting and nothing like i had ever seen before, let alone on my own body! It covered my entire upper back, incredibly red and little bumps everywhere with some areas of large bumps that were painful like a bruise. I read other reviews were people experienced cystic breakouts - i had never even heard of that before and when i checked out pictures online, sure enough that was what i was seeing on my back! To never ever have experienced something like this before, it is incredibility disheartening that a product can produce such a side effect on someone who does not normally breakout and do not consider myself to have sensitive skin (some find Proactiv incredibly sensitive to them and it has worked great for me). Its summertime and with how my back looks currently, it'll be WEEKS before i'll be able to show my back, wear a tank top or a bathing suit. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.<br /><br />I hardly ever write reviews on anything i buy (like almost never) but wanted to share my experience with this product because i have just been searching and searching for a good hair growth product and thought this may have been it. I probably only took 5 or 6 pills when side effects starting occurring and now looking back on other symptoms, i had one day with a crippling headache (i hardly ever get them) where it felt like i had a brain freeze all day and other days had stomach cramps that i just thought not much of. I would be weary to anyone looking to buy this product who even fears slightly about breaking out and thinking it can be managed...this is NOTHING like i have ever experienced before and have never been so disappointed after purchasing a product with so many good reviews.

Perfumes in particular tend to be a problem, and finding a commercial face powder without perfume can be challenging. This is a finely milled rice powder and goes on silky smooth with the included foam pad applicator. It has a sifter built into the box, so the powder won't get everywhere when you open the box and it doesn't leak in storage. It has no discernible perfumes, goes on translucent and gives a fine matte finish to your bare skin or to your makeup no matter what your skin tone might be. I generally don't wear foundation, but do use this over sunblock to kill the shine. Used over foundation it will set your makeup for extra long wear. I highly recommend this!",7/14/2013

My problem was how many passes and coats I had to apply to get a good color coverage. It took about 3 coats to equal up to what one coat of my favorite looks like. As far as how long it lasts, it did a good 6 hours before I needed to touch up, and I also had to touch up my favorite mascara as well. So not bad there. This mascara didn't have any flaking either, so that's good. And as far as it holding up against water, it did that great as well. My other mascara isn't waterproof, so I couldn't compare.<br /><br />Overall it's not bad, but it wasn't good enough to change me over from my current favorite brand.

Even with black-out curtains I have trouble falling asleep. One thing I've noticed that really helps are sleeping masks. With that being said, I've tried quite a few and I haven't found one that completely blocked out the light or was comfortable to wear. This mask is different, and possibly one of the best I've ever worn to bed. I purchased a homemade one on Etsy that is still my favorite (because I like the owl print on it), but this one is half the price and just as good in quality- which is why I'm rating it 5 stars.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about this sleeping mask was the thickness. No light is going to get through this mask! It seems a little bulky at first- especially if you're used to the thin silk masks that are commonly sold. With that being said, once you get used to wearing something like this you'll notice a significant difference in the amount of light that gets through. It truly does create a blacked out environment that is really nice.<br /><br />The mask fit my head perfectly. I have pretty average head size, so I think I can fairly say that this mask can be adjusted to fit anyone. The mask can be adjusted with little sliding adjusters and then has a clasp in the back that secures the mask around your head. The company boasts that the clasp won't snag in hair- and I have very snaggly fine hair. So far it hasn't gotten tangled in my hair, although sometimes I do accidently clasp a few strands of hair into the clip and it pulls them out when I roll around. I just put my hair in a low pony tail to avoid that problem.<br /><br />One thing that I really love about this mask is that it's contoured to fit around the bridge of your nose. Most sleeping masks don't adequate fit around your nose so have small gaps where light can get through. That is not the case with this mask. Because it fits snug around all of the curves of your face- literally no light gets through. That is something that my Etsy eye mask did not have, and it is a feature that a I REALLY appreciated on this specific mask. I have a Jewish nose (a big nose) and it fits well over it.<br /><br />Overall, I do really like this mask. The clasp sometimes clips onto your hair (but that's my own fault for not being more careful), but other than that it's a great product. Very quality sewn and made with good materials. It has a very pretty leafy design (I got the Emerald Forest print) and fits well to my face. I'd definitely recommend this mask for anyone looking for a sleep aid. It'd make a great gift too, and comes in a very pretty box!k did not have, and it is a feature that a I REALLY appreciated on this specific mask.

I'm very happy with the waves I get with this tool. Before purchasing, I watched several YouTube videos on how to use it, and they had a lot of great tips. Working in small sections seems to work best for me and I like to divide the hair into several layers to get more volume, as well. The trickiest part is definitely the top of the head because, if you don't get close enough to the scalp and angle it just right, you can end up with the awful crease so many have mentioned. I find that starting the waves at the top with the back plate facing outward and then continuing the waves with the tool facing the &#34;right&#34; way (barrels facing outward) helps avoid the crease. Just some of my tips.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Creates nice waves that last all day (and then some, in my case).<br />- Latch keeps the barrels closed when not in use.<br />- Adjustable temperature dial.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Very large and heavy (and thus, a bit awkward and tiring to use).<br />- No stand to keep the tool from resting directly on the countertop or other surface.<br />- The lever used to clamp down on the hair feels quite fragile (cheap plastic), so avoid clamping down too hard.",8/19/2015

I would recommend this mirror just remember it is 5&#34;.,1/2/2014

Simply just adore them! They're the highest quality I have personally used. They can be shaped, and filed if you choose to do that. They allow polish to go on very well. Nor are they thin, or flimsy. I haven't tried them with gel polish, but I imagine they would work for that too. I didn't have nail glue surprisingly, so I glued a couple to some cardboard with hot glue. (Bad Idea now that I did it.) but, I did test them out, with some polishes, and nail art. I found that the only two that don't fit my fingers are 9 and 0, which are the ones I glued to the cardboard. 0, was too big, and, would require a lot of shaping to get right. and 9 was too skinny. The point starts right after my natural nail bed, too and curves into a soft not sharp point. They have a natural in-curve to like your real nails would, if you filed them that way. They really are natural and I am sure they are comfortable, I will test that when I get some nail glue. This isn't my normal shape, but I find I like to try new things, so I am excited to get them on and try them out, that way too! They feel great just pressing them to see if they fit, and its nice because I can file them shorter to wear to work. since we can't have acrylics!

I mixed up several oils and gave them as gifts to friends only to get phone calls that the oils would not come out of the bottle. Either the rollers didn't roll or they could roll them with their finger but not get them to dispense to apply. I tried one myself after being alerted of this. The oils would not dispense, I even tried priming the ball with some oil to help facilitate the process. Frustrated I contacted the seller. The seller advised that &#34;if the ball rolls, the oil will come out, and to tap the bottom while holding the bottle upside down.&#34; So I tried doing so & still nothing came out. I tried leaving it on the counter overnight upside down thinking it will either leak like crazy or at least the oil should lubricate around the ball and it should dispense. Still nothing. I have tried repeatedly to rub the roller on my arm, shaking, tapping & pushing down hard & it just will not dispense. Finally, I pulled the whole roller mechanism out & threw it away.

I felt as though I had as good a shave as I get with a Gillette Fusion razor using shaving gel. I also have a Parker butterfly-open double edge razor, but I feel that the Merkur is a better razor in that the blade angle is at the precise angle I need.",8/28/2015

There is nothing like it that I know of available in the U.S. I would never have known about this but I traveled to Japan where it is available just about anywhere. Every sunscreen I have tried in the U.S. that offers this level of SPF is either greasy, smells awful, sits on your skin, makes you feel like you're wrapped in plastic, gets on your clothes, furniture, etc. and possibly staining these surfaces, makes your eyes sting, and when used on your face causes clogged pores. Some of the sunscreens are nearly impossible to wash off. So let me tell you what I LOVE about this product: It is relatively inexpensive (you are paying more because someone has to get it from Japan), it goes on like silk and absorbs quickly--once it's on, you're no longer aware that you're wearing it, it smells fresh and clean when you apply but doesn't linger, you can wear it on your face without breakouts--I wear it every day for a foundation, and it will not make your eyes water.

It goes on smooth and starts to darken pretty quickly.

But as long as you rub it in well there shouldn't be any streaking, and the color is great once it darkens. It does smell a bit funny once it darkens (but not at first), so when I use it I put it on at night so that I can shower the odor away in the morning but still have the color. The color lasts about 2-3 days if you don't reapply and shower daily. If you reapply, it would last for as long as you used it. I took off one star because it's a smallish tube for the price, and because I was hoping it would be gentle enough to use on my face since it's Alba.

You may have to build it up a bit to get the color as shown in the palette but I don't mind it. Helps to use a primer before hand, if you can use a white one even better.

Just a couple of shakes on my cotton pad make up remover. Just pressing it against my eye for a few seconds removes all of my eye make up. Then I just keep rubbing gently over my eye until they're all gone. Then with the same pad I remove the make up on my other eye. No need for adding more of the liquid. It does the job even for water proof products. It is oily but not in a bad way, after washing my face there are still some of the Bifesta around my eyes but it ends up moisturizing my eyes over night when I go to bed. By the morning, my eyes aren't greasy or feels like it either and ready to start the day with new make up. Had no problems putting make up on in the mornings. Not sure about removing any fine lines around the eyes like some other reviewer has said, but it has brightened it up a bit. I've used the cheap make up remover that's 99 cents at the stores and it would make my eyes water ever night. Always had tissue and would dab A LOT of tears off every night when using the 99 cents one. My eyes haven't teared up at all since using Bifesta unless I'm yawning. Maybe it's just me but I love the results and it does the job perfectly. This has become my favorite and permanent makeup remover. Almost forgot to mention, there are no English writing. For best results, shake the bottle before use. Oil floats to the top while the rest are at the bottom so you'll get all oil if not shaken.",6/29/2015
